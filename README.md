# Build-a-Search-Engine-Python
This is a project in a course called "Intro to Computer Science-Build a Search Engine and a Social Network" on Udacity.
The instructor for this course is Professor Dave Evans who I think is an excellent teacher.

Throughout this course, I build a search engine by learning about and producing key search engine components including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm. As I build these pieces, I learned about and practiced computer science skills.

This project was realized in Python.
